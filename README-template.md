## Overview

My new challenge with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5.2 Accordion. It's not very good solution, but at this time, it's enough I think. I worked as usual with HTML and CSS, but this time I added Accordeon with Bootstrap 5.2, it's first time I worked with Bootstrap, I think it's normal. Here is one problem, what I checked, accordions arrow showing just in Firefox, not in Google Chrome, I don't know solution at this time but I will check it for future, maybe found something. I used Bootstrap, because t this time I'm too weak in JS, will rewrite in the future, when I will ready for JS.
